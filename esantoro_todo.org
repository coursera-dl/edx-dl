#+TITLE: Personal to_do


* Main topics:

* Multiple user agents

edx-dl users should be able to pick a different user agent in order to
prevent edx from filtering http requests on user agents.

Edx doesn't yet, but they could.

** How ?

Provide some default user agents: Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Internet
Exploder.

Then provide an option to use a command-line provided user agent or a
user agent from a environment variable.

* Alternative download directory

I like to keep all of my courses into a different directory, and I'd
like to be able to specify that somewhere.


* Handle CTRL-C properly

Just implement a "catch KeyboardInterrupt" in the main loop.

* DONE Configuration file

Settings like the above ones should be saveable in a dotfile in the
user home directory, except for (at least) password.
