# DESCRIPTION

Simple tool to download video lectures from edx.org. 

You are recommended to use stand-alone executables. Choose the link according to your operating system,
 * [Windows](https://github.com/coiby/edx-downloader/blob/master/standalone/Windows.zip?raw=true)
 * [Linux](https://github.com/coiby/edx-downloader/blob/master/standalone/Linux.zip?raw=true)
 * [Mac](https://github.com/coiby/edx-downloader/blob/master/standalone/Mac.zip?raw=true)

Otherwise, it requires the Python interpreter (> 2.6), youtube-dl, BeautifulSoup4 and it's
platform independent.  It should work fine in your Unix box, in Windows or in Mac OS X.

# DEPENDENCIES

If you use the stand-alone executables converted by PyInstaller, ignore this part.

## youtube-dl
By default, this program will download video from CDN directly. However there may be some videos hosted only on youtube. So you are recommened to install `youtube-dl`. Also, since Youtube changes its
layout frequently, make sure that the version of `youtube-dl` that you have
installed is the latest. If in doubt, run `youtube-dl --update`. 

You can find `youtube-dl` at <http://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html>.

## BeautifulSoup

Scrapping the web can be very silly task, but BeautifulSoup makes it
so easy :), it isn't included in the python standard library.  Make
sure you have BeautifulSoup installed.

You can install it with

    pip install beautifulsoup4

or

    easy_install beautifulsoup4.

# Files

## edx-dl.py
Python implementation for edx-downloader

The original file was written by @shk3 in/for `python3` then updated
by @emadshaaban92 for python2, and migrated for versions superior to
2.6 by @iemejia.

# Quick Start

To use `edx-dl.py`, simply excute it, as in:

    python edx-dl.py

You will then be asked your username and password.

Your downloaded videos will be placed in a new Directory called
"Downloaded".  The script is very interactive, and if you have a issue
please tell us.

You can also excute it with arguments given: email and password,
as in:

    python edx-dl.py [-u user@user.com] [-p password]
    
If you want to download video from youtube instead of CDN, append the parameter `--no-cdn` to the command,

    python edx-dl.py [-u user@user.com] [-p password] --no-cdn
